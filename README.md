Overall, the development of this game was at times steady and in other parts, a very steep climb. So far, I managed to have a front end page that looks prepared and organized. However, there are still a few backend problems that have not been solved. Some include the following...
Unsolved problems:
1. sign-up/sign-in form fields won't clear
2. sign-out breaks
3. gameHistory does not return games played (401 error)
4. gameBoard does not place x or o into table squares
```
The game did not turn out as expected, but this was a good learning experience on how to attempt future applications and projects.
